# Diabetic-retinopathy-evaluation


Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss. According to a recent study from International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalence of DR among the individuals with diabetes for the period from 2015 to 2019 was at more than 25%. According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide have diabetes, and the disease prevalence has been rising rapidly in developing countries.

     Early detection and treatment are crucial steps towards preventing DR. Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming process. The screening procedure requires a trained clinical expert to examine the fundus photographs of the patient’s retina. This creates delays in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Automated evaluation of retina photographs can speed up the efficiency and coverage of the DR screening programs. This is especially relevant for developing countries, which often lack qualified medical stuff to perform the diagnosis.

     The project aims at developing a deep learning model for predicting the severity of DR disease based on the patient’s retina photograph. Previous research has explored the usage of deep learning for detecting DR and concluded that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have high potential in this task . The Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) has launched two Kaggle competitions with a goal of promoting the use of deep learning for DR detection and boosting the development of automated detection systems.


     This data set is provided by APTOS. It has been employed in the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition on Kaggle and is available for the download at the competition website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data. The data set includes 3,662 labeled retina images of clinical patients. The images are taken using a fundus photography technique.

     All of the images are already saved into their respective folders according to the severity/stage of diabetic retinopathy using the train.csv file provided. You will find five categories with the respective images:

0 - No_DR

1 - Mild

2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferate_DR
